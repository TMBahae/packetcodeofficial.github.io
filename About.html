    <div class="FAQ">
        <p class="FAQparagraph">
            1. How can I practice my English?
            <br>
            You can use the text channels on the server and the voice channels when you see people in them. Practising your English actively this way is a great way to advance your skills. In addition, you can use the special chat channels to talk specifically about the topics that interest you. Questions about English can be asked in #📚│english-question and you can find helpful English learning resources in #🗃│resource. and you can always join the classes.
            <br><br>   
            2. What do the colours mean?
            <br>
            Colours most often represent the person's level in English but can also show that a person is a  "teacher" or nitro booster (boosters get to choose a custom role and colour for them). Click (or long press on mobile) a username to see what roles a person has.
            <br><br>
            3. I feel stupid making mistakes or forgetting things, what to do? 
            <br>
            All learners know that feeling! Especially in a community where you expose yourself to everybody. And that's exactly why you shouldn't feel bad about it! We're all supposed to help one another here, so don't apologize for the mistakes made! We're volunteers and it's worth it to us if you feel good practicing here. Also, if it seems to you that someone isn't complying with the mindset explained here, feel free to report them to staff using #🛂│report-help
